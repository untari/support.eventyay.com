### 6. Filling information 


Put in the information for name, level, type (Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver...) and the sponsor website's. 


You can always add a short abstract or description about your sponsor. You can choose your sponsor's logo (remember to ensure the size is no bigger than 1MB for best resolution).
